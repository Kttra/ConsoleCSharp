# Consoles in C#
Using console commands in C# (Command Line Prompt, PowerShell, Scripts). This program was created because fancy GUI's and UI's are not always neccessary to make. Sometimes just having a simple light-weight console window will suffice and starting off programming for console is a great way to learn.
